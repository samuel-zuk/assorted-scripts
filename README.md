# toolbox

This is where I dump things (scripts, templates, etc.) that I'll probably need
at one point or another. Sorted into subdirectories, with more info in each
directory's respective README file.

### utility-scripts

Shell scripts I wrote to do some very specific task at one point or another.

### templates

Files containing boilerplate code/text for all sorts of things.
